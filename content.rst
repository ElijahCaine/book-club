    *For the month of November, 2015*

This month the LUG Book Club will be participating in National Novel Writing
Month, or `NaNoWriMo`_. If you choose to participate you will spend the next
month putting in your best effort to produce a ~50,000 word novel.

    *National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is a fun, seat-of-your-pants
    approach to creative writing.*

    *On November 1, participants begin working towards the goal of writing a
    50,000-word novel by 11:59 PM on November 30.*

    *Valuing enthusiasm, determination, and a deadline, NaNoWriMo is for anyone
    who has ever thought about writing a novel.*

How Do I Write A Novel in a Month?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a lot of great resources available to help you get started and keep
writing once you've begun.

* The `NaNoWriMo Writing Tracker`_ can help you keep on task too by adding a
  social aspect to the writing process.
* NaNoWriMo's official site also has an entire `Get Inspired`_ section you
  should check out to get your ball rolling.
* Mythmon wrote a cool GitHub badge for online repositories storing their
  novels in Git. It is called the `NaNoWriMo Badge`_.
* And of course you can join us in the ##lugbookclub channel on
  irc.freenode.net to discuss your writing and ask for tips and advice. :)

Of course there's no harm in missing the mark. NaNoWriMo is about having fun,
not stress or losing sleep. Enjoy the experience, push yourself a little bit,
and feel the creative juices flow.

So We're *Not* Reading a Book?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to participate in the writing portion of this event we are
also reading the book `Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom`_ by `Cory Doctrow`_.

Down and Out is available in hard cover for purchase at your local book store,
at most online retailers, and available `for free from the author`_.

Meetup Info: Early December. Location TBD

Wait what's happening?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We read a book and congregate in meatspace to discuss what we read over drinks
and such.

In theory we meet around the third Saturday of every month in Portland Oregon.
In practice we meet whenever we are all available (decided by a Doodle Poll)

----

Some of the members of the #osu-lug community realized they were unhappy with
their level of use of technology. As awesome as computers are they would rather
do something *away* from the screen now and then.

So basically a few members of the community hastily decided 'LETS START A BOOK
CLUB!!!' and now this exists.

We read a book every month and come together in meatspace to discuss said book.
What we liked, what we didn't, etc.

----

If you have a suggestion for a good title to read, or you'd like to host the
next meetup, contact Eli. If you got here you probably know how to do that
already.

If you don't want to contact Eli directly, but like using Github, create an
issue on titled ``<book title> (<book author>)`` on `this page's github repo`_.

The format does not need to explicitly follow that, just make it clear who the
author is and what the title is to avoid confusion.

Voting
~~~~~~

If you would like to vote for a book to be read by the book club, add a +1 in
the comments of the issue created for that book's nomination.

Every month the three book suggestions (Github issues) with the most ``+1``
nominations will be put into a strawpoll and voted on for the next month's
book. Eli may executive decide to put one book on the ballot that was not
highly voted, but there will always be some pre-democracy in the ballot.

If time is short and Eli forget's to draw up a ballot before the month begins
he will decide on a book to read, sans democracy.
