Next Month: Help decide!
------------------------

Check out `the etherpad`_ to help us determine what book to read

Wait what's happening?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We read a book and congregate in meatspace to discuss what we read over drinks
and such. We meet around the third Saturday of every month in Portland Oregon.

Some of the members of the #osu-lug community realized they were unhappy with
their level of use of technology. As awesome as computers are they would rather
do something *away* from the screen now and then.

So basically a few members of the community hastily decided 'LETS START A BOOK
CLUB!!!' and now this exists.

We read a book every month and come together in meatspace to discuss said book.
What we liked, what we didn't, etc.

If you have a suggestion for a good title to read, or you'd like to host the
next meetup, contact Eli. If you got here you probably know how to do that
already.

If you don't want to contact Eli directly, create an issue tagged 'book
suggestion' on `this page's github repo`_
