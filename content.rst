Answer this poll to help us determine the September-October book choice:
http://strawpoll.me/5383204

The book will be decided Friday September 5th, 2015 (11:59:59.999999999999999).

Wait what's happening?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We read a book and congregate in meatspace to discuss what we read over drinks
and such.

In theory we meet around the third Saturday of every month in Portland Oregon.
In practice we meet whenever we are all available (decided by a Doodle Poll)

----

Some of the members of the #osu-lug community realized they were unhappy with
their level of use of technology. As awesome as computers are they would rather
do something *away* from the screen now and then.

So basically a few members of the community hastily decided 'LETS START A BOOK
CLUB!!!' and now this exists.

We read a book every month and come together in meatspace to discuss said book.
What we liked, what we didn't, etc.

----

If you have a suggestion for a good title to read, or you'd like to host the
next meetup, contact Eli. If you got here you probably know how to do that
already.

If you don't want to contact Eli directly, but like using Github, create an
issue on titled ``<book title> (<book author>)`` on `this page's github repo`_.

The format does not need to explicitly follow that, just make it clear who the
author is and what the title is to avoid confusion.

Voting
~~~~~~

If you would like to vote for a book to be read by the book club, add a +1 in
the comments of the issue created for that book's nomination.

Every month the three book suggestions (Github issues) with the most ``+1``
nominations will be put into a strawpoll and voted on for the next month's
book. Eli may executive decide to put one book on the ballot that was not
highly voted, but there will always be some pre-democracy in the ballot.
